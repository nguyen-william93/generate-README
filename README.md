## README Generator

This code ultilize the node.js techonology. From node.js, we installed a package called inquirer. By using inquirer, the code was able to prompt the user, in an orderly fashion, and pass that information back for the coder(me). I, then, used that information to generate a professional readme.md. 

## About
The story of the code is to:
    AS A developer
    I WANT a README generator
    SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

## Criteria
    GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
    WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
    THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
    WHEN I enter my project title
    THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
    WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
    THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
    WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
    THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
    WHEN I enter my GitHub username
    THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
    WHEN I enter my email address
    THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
    WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
    THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
